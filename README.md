#Linkester.js

> * Highlight href and displays information about it in a tooltip

To see how it works  pass the mouse over the links in this demo page:
##[View Demo](http://zainali99.github.io)

#Welcome to version 0.2

###linkester.applyTo(element);
```javascript
    
    window.onload = function(){
    linkester.applyTo(".container");
    }
``````

#####results of the tests
Due to slowdowns and problems related to websites with their settings, linkester can't send requests with ajax.

so I just created another event to get the title of the page manually, of course, works only on domains with no header set.
